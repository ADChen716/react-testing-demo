This repo shows you how to test React component. It is loosely based on Jack Franklin's article ["Testing React Applications"](http://12devsofxmas.co.uk/2015/12/day-2-testing-react-applications/).

## Introduction

We use two testing approaches.

- [React official Test Utilities](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html)
- [Airbnb's Enzyme Library](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)

Each approaches have two ways to do the testing.

- **Shallow Rendering**: render the component into a React Object instance
- **DOM Rendering**: render the component into a real DOM node

We will cover all of these stuffs.

## Demo

We use a Todo app as the demo. It contains three components.
